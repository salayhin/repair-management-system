# Simple Role Syntax
# ==================
# Supports bulk-adding hosts to roles, the primary server in each group
# is considered to be the first unless any hosts have the primary
# property set.  Don't declare `role :all`, it's a meta role.
#
#role :app, %w{deploy@example.com}
#role :web, %w{deploy@example.com}
#role :db,  %w{deploy@example.com}

# set your own server's IP

role :web, "104.237.196.10" # Your HTTP server, Apache/etc
role :app, "104.237.196.10" # This may be the same as your `Web` server
role :db, "104.237.196.10", :primary => true # This is where Rails migrations will run

set :deploy_to, '/home/apps/rms' # change the directory of project

set 'rails_env', :production

# Extended Server Syntax
# ======================
# This can be used to drop a more detailed server definition into the
# server list. The second argument is a, or duck-types, Hash and is
# used to set extended properties on the server.

#server 'example.com', user: 'deploy', roles: %w{web app}, my_property: :my_value


# Custom SSH Options
# ==================
# You may pass any option but keep in mind that net/ssh understands a
# limited set of options, consult[net/ssh documentation](http://net-ssh.github.io/net-ssh/classes/Net/SSH.html#method-c-start).
